# HStash
H-Stash is a Stash-Box instance dedicated to internet-based animated works, *not* the full-length Hentai episodes that *are* accepted in the main StashDB instance. <!--todo add links to stash-box github and stashdb url-->

In this instance, "Performers" are "Characters", and "Studios" are "Artists" - If you'd like to have this terminology reflected on your stash instance, you can import the localization here: <!--todo add localization url-->

This GitHub merely acts as a supplemental feed for the actual HStash instance itself - Once it goes public, you can find URLs to the Wiki and the instance itself below.
