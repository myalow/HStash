# HStash
H-Stash is a Stash-Box instance dedicated to internet-based animated works, *not* the full-length Hentai episodes that *are* accepted in the main StashDB instance. <!--todo add links to stash-box github and stashdb url-->

In this instance, "Performers" are "Characters", and "Studios" are "Artists" - If you'd like to have this terminology reflected on your stash instance, you can import the localization here: <!--todo add localization url-->

This GitHub merely acts as a supplemental feed for the actual HStash instance itself - Once it goes public, you can find URLs to the Wiki and the instance itself below.

## Rough Guidelines
The following are some rough guidelines to follow when submitting a scene to HStash

**PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT ANY 'LOLICON' OR ANY SIMILARLY AGE-BAITY CONTENT**

There is a bit of interpretation to be had when things are or are not 'loli'. I recommend erring on the side of caution. You're also more than welcome to spin up a Stash-Box instance that is tolerant to that sort of content, but I want to play things safe with HStash.

### Scenes
 - Try to include a URL to the source material, whether that be a Twitter URL, Newgrounds, etc. Try *not* to link to Gelbooru, Rule34 etc.
 - Please try to include as many applicable scene tags as possible, including character descriptions etc.
### Performers
 - For characters from a pre-established series (eg. Overwatch), you can submit them with just their name
   - If two characters share a name, however, please use the disambiguation field in HStash to notate which series your character is from
 - For OCs, please always notate who the creator is in the disambiguation field.
 - Please do not make seperate performers for different 'skins' of a character. Instead, try your best to be as descriptive as possible with scene tags.

### Artists
 - For artist photos, a Twitter profile photo should work as a stand-in for the "Studio" "Logo".
   - Please do not attach an IRL photo of the artist itself.
   - **However**, if an artist does have their own logo, that is preferred to something like a Twitter photo.

Any additional questions, you are more than welcome to reach out on Discord.
